I'm a pretty regular guy. 
I enjoy, in no particular order, traveling, playing music, doing mathematics and programming.
If you want to know more, why don't you [ask me](mailto:victor.cacciari@gmail.com) yourself?

About this *blog*, on the other hand, I can write a few words. 
The idea started as a simple alternative to social networks for me to have a personal
page somewhere to keep my ideas at. I plan to
keep a blog of thoughts, ramblings, programming, mathematics... well, whatever
comes to my mind, whenever.

Although I have a CV and some professional info, 
this is supposed to be pretty informal place. Thus don't take anything here for
the absolut truth. 

That's it for now.
