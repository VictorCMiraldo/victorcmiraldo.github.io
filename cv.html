<li><a href="https://github.com/VictorCMiraldo/msc-agda-tactics">MSc dissertation</a>. My Master’s dissertation is a combination of different topics. On one side we wanted to explore some form of proof automation in Agda, from where the <a href="https://github.com/VictorCMiraldo/agda-rw">by</a> tactic was born. On the other hand, we wanted to use such tactic to provide a better equational reasoning framework for Relational Algebra. <a href="data/MiraldoMsc.pdf">pdf</a></li>

<h3 id="section-1"><strong>2013 - 2014</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Research Grant on <em>QAIS</em> Project.<br />
University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.<br />
Supervised by Professor José Nuno Oliveira.<br />
During this grant we investigated a calculus for probabilistic systems. The punchline is to use what we already have for functional programming and lift it to <strong>Mat</strong>, the Category of Matrices and Matrix Multiplication while modelling components as Monadic Mealy Machines, over the sub-distribution monad.</li>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Research Grant on <em>AVIACC</em> Project.<br />
University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.<br />
Supervised by Professors Jorge Sousa Pinto and Maria João Frade.<br />
This project was a mix of theory and practice. One objective was to understand the abstraction algorithms used in two industrial-strength Software Model Checkers. Namelly <em>SLAM</em> and <em>SATABS</em>. We found out that cartesian abstraction and the direct method are closer than we believed. Whereas another objective was to develop a software model checker for <em>Spark</em>, a subset of <em>Ada</em>. This development was integrated in a bigger effort, to also develop a bounded model checker for the language.</li>

<ul>
<li>Integration into Research Grant on<br />
“Interpretations of the lambda-calculus on interaction nets.”<br />
University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.<br />
Supervised by Professors José Carlos Espírito Santo and Jorge Sousa Pinto.<br />
This was my first contact with research. We studied how one could <em>implement</em> the lambda-calculus with a call-by-value evaluation semantics into interaction nets, which is a formalism very suitable for parallel computations. The process goes through translating a term to its equivalent logical proposition, encoding it in linear logic, going for it’s proof net representation and, finally, translating to a specific set of interaction nets. <a href="data/LambdaCalc-report-PT.pdf">pdf (Portuguese)</a></li>
