Here is where you are going to find somewhat more detailed information about my academic background.
This page is intended to be a informal *CV*. For specifics, such as transcript of records and
diplomas, contact me via e-mail.

# Research

### **2014 - 2015**

> - [MSc dissertation](https://github.com/VictorCMiraldo/msc-agda-tactics).
>   My Master's dissertation is a combination of different topics. 
>   On one side we wanted to explore some form of proof automation in
>   Agda, from where the [by](https://github.com/VictorCMiraldo/agda-rw)
>   tactic was born. On the other hand, we wanted to use such tactic to
>   provide a better equational reasoning framework for Relational Algebra.
>   [pdf](data/MiraldoMsc.pdf)


### **2013 - 2014**

> - Research Grant on *QAIS* Project.  
>   University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.  
>   Supervised by Professor José Nuno Oliveira.  
>   During this grant we investigated a calculus for probabilistic systems.
>   The punchline is to use what we already have for functional programming
>   and lift it to **Mat**, the Category of Matrices and Matrix Multiplication while
>   modelling components as Monadic Mealy Machines, over the sub-distribution monad.
 
### **2012 - 2013**

> - Research Grant on *AVIACC* Project.  
>   University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.  
>   Supervised by Professors Jorge Sousa Pinto and Maria João Frade.  
>   This project was a mix of theory and practice. One objective was to understand the abstraction
>   algorithms used in two industrial-strength Software Model Checkers. Namelly *SLAM* and *SATABS*.
>   We found out that cartesian abstraction and the direct method are closer than we believed.
>   Whereas another objective was to develop a software model checker for *Spark*, a subset of *Ada*.
>   This development was integrated in a bigger effort, to also develop a bounded model checker
>   for the language.

### **2011 - 2012**

> - Integration into Research Grant on  
>  "Interpretations of the lambda-calculus on interaction nets."  
>   University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.  
>   Supervised by Professors José Carlos Espírito Santo and Jorge Sousa Pinto.  
>   This was my first contact with research. We studied how one could *implement*
>   the lambda-calculus with a call-by-value evaluation semantics into interaction nets,
>   which is a formalism very suitable for parallel computations. The process goes through
>   translating a term to its equivalent logical proposition, encoding it in linear logic,
>   going for it's proof net representation and, finally, translating to a specific set of
>   interaction nets. [pdf (Portuguese)](data/LambdaCalc-report-PT.pdf)


# Education

### **2015 - Future**

> - I am currently enroled as a PhD candidate at University of Utrecht, the Netherlands.
