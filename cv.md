# Research

### **2017 - 2020**

> - Continuation of my PhD at Utrecht University.
>
> - Part-time employee of Oracle Labs, continuing the work
>   performed during my internship.

### **2017 - 2017**

> - Internship at Oracle Labs Burlington, where I worked in the
>   Scalable Synchronization Group (SSRG) under the supervision of
>   Mark Moir. We conducted research in the blockchain area.

### **2015 - 2017**

> - PhD Candidate at Utrecht University, Software-Technology group,
>   under the supervision of Wouter Swierstra. Paused the PhD for an
>   internship.

### **2014 - 2015**

> - [MSc dissertation](https://github.com/VictorCMiraldo/msc-agda-tactics).
>   My Master's dissertation is a combination of different topics.
>   On one side we wanted to explore some form of proof automation in
>   Agda, from where the [by](https://github.com/VictorCMiraldo/agda-rw)
>   tactic was born. On the other hand, we wanted to use such tactic to
>   provide a better equational reasoning framework for Relational Algebra.
>   [pdf](data/MiraldoMsc.pdf)


### **2013 - 2014**

> - Research Grant on *QAIS* Project.
>   University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.
>   Supervised by Professor José Nuno Oliveira.
>   During this grant we investigated a calculus for probabilistic systems.
>   The punchline is to use what we already have for functional programming
>   and lift it to **Mat**, the Category of Matrices and Matrix Multiplication while
>   modelling components as Monadic Mealy Machines, over the sub-distribution monad.

### **2012 - 2013**

> - Research Grant on *AVIACC* Project.
>   University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.
>   Supervised by Professors Jorge Sousa Pinto and Maria João Frade.
>   This project was a mix of theory and practice. One objective was to understand the abstraction
>   algorithms used in two industrial-strength Software Model Checkers. Namelly *SLAM* and *SATABS*.
>   We found out that cartesian abstraction and the direct method are closer than we believed.
>   Whereas another objective was to develop a software model checker for *Spark*, a subset of *Ada*.
>   This development was integrated in a bigger effort, to also develop a bounded model checker
>   for the language.

### **2011 - 2012**

> - Integration into Research Grant on
>  "Interpretations of the lambda-calculus on interaction nets."
>   University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.
>   Supervised by Professors José Carlos Espírito Santo and Jorge Sousa Pinto.
>   This was my first contact with research. We studied how one could *implement*
>   the lambda-calculus with a call-by-value evaluation semantics into interaction nets,
>   which is a formalism very suitable for parallel computations. The process goes through
>   translating a term to its equivalent logical proposition, encoding it in linear logic,
>   going for it's proof net representation and, finally, translating to a specific set of
>   interaction nets. [pdf (Portuguese)](data/LambdaCalc-report-PT.pdf)
