Hi, I'm Victor, it is nice to meet you! I'm passionate about Functional Programming
and Formal Verification. I believe formal methods and functional programming 
are essential in building software that is reliable, maintainable and reusable.
I am currently working at [Tweag I/O](https://www.tweag.io) as a research
software engineer. My work ranges from building to modelling and verifying
software from various domains.
