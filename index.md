I am currently enroled as a PhD candidate at University of Utrecht, the Netherlands.
My project is somewhere along the lines of *structure-aware version control systems*,
supervised by Wouter Swierstra.
 
Our goal is to develop a datatype-generic approach to diffing, in Agda. Having
a solid and formal notion of diffing should let us also tackle the problem of merging
structured data, which lieas at the heart of the difficulties for version control.
