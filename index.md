I am currently enroled as a PhD candidate at University of Utrecht,
the Netherlands.  My project is somewhere along the lines of
*structure-aware version control systems*, *generic programming* and
*dependently typed programming*. My supervisor is Wouter Swierstra.
 
Our goal is to develop a datatype-generic approach to diffing abstract
syntax trees. We use Haskell and Agda to program and verify our
techniques. Having a solid and formal notion of diffing should let us
also tackle the problem of merging structured data, which lieas at the
heart of the difficulties for version control.
