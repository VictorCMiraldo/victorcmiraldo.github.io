We know the future is arriving when we start to hear about the [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things).
In a nutshell, imagine you buy a super-awesome microwave oven from the future. This oven has the ability
to read information from food packaging and perfectly cook your meal. How do this work? Well,
chances are your microwave is going to have something analogous to an IP, 
and is going to access the meal vendor's server to
retrieve information on how to cook it.

I'm quite used to receive the -- *Oh, but that is amazing* -- reaction from people. I can't
help but disagree completely with that. We're drowning ourselfes in a sea of comunicating gadgets
and soon it will be to late to start swimming to the surface. Let me enumerate a few problems
I thought off.

Security. I recently came across an [article](http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/security-hardening/the-internet-of-things-why-security-needs-to-be-the-future-of-iot/) that I could not agree more.
I will not delve into technical details for I don't want to be the bad-news-bringer. Go read it!

Time. Don't you notice that the more gadgets and social blablabla accounts you keep, 
the less time you actually have to do anything? It's an interesting trap we have been constructing
for ourselfes. Although these **I**nternet **D**evices allow you to do things faster, it looks
like the amount of things you have to do on a daily basis also increases. It already is not very
hard to imagine waking up in the morning and having all your devices programmed and sync'ed with your alarm clock.
You wake up, turn off the alarm, which triggers your kitchen-pilot-2000 to start making your coffee
and your toast... That is absurd. I, for instance, enjoy cooking my own breakfast. It gives me
time to think, which is becomming a rare hobby among earthlings. Can we really get to that level
of laziness? And that's not to mention interfaces... from my first alarm clock, to setting up my mobile phone
alarm every night, I went from 2 or 3 button presses to 10 or 12...

Technology is pretty much like a hike. If we don't ponder, honestly, the path we are walking
against the ones we chose not to walk, we might arrive somewhere unexpected, or even worse,
get lost. Why are we so eager to *digitalize* every aspect of our lifes? Aren't we running
in the wrong direction?
