While hanging out with some friends, somebody mentioned a few interesting links from google.
No, not like google searches, more like google options. Did you know that google
has formed an opinion over you? Are you sure you want to [know](http://t.co/hSxzJaPf)?
I have to say that if they added a dating service into that all-pretty framework of theirs
it would be a huge success! They really knew me, at least before I opted out.
The most interesting part is that upon opting out of that *service*, they just tell
you that you will still see ads, they will be a bit less targeted though. And then I ask,
can you really opt-out?

Needless to say, this shaped our discussion throughtout that night. The portion of our lifes that is available
on the world wide web is strikingly big, and we pretend that either we don't notice or we don't care.
It makes me wonder, soon will be the time where we will have perfect biographies available.
Even better, maybe some blue social network will actually render, automatically, your biography when you die!
I bet some will find this amazing, and they can't wait to see their own biographies... oh... wait...
Jokes aside, if this idea makes your mind go unquiet, I can't help but recommend you to
watch [Black Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror_%28TV_series%29).

How did we get so far? From a few years ago, where the internet was the cornerstone of information,
to now, where we still have that information, but with 42 km of futility on top of it.
We are creating the habit of making our lifes digital. Even worse is pushing
this to the younger generations. It makes me sad to see 2 or 3 years old with gadgets, connected to the internet,
in their hands. Some might say I am an extremist, missing the old days of a more analogical world. 
Others say that gadgets helps the child develop his/her brain. So does lego!

I just defend the need to ponder and reflect about the habits we are forging. Education is the key.
Technology is a concept we are not yet fully familiarized, and it is not hard to imagine a few scary
futures ahead of us. We are creating gadgets that do solve our (or what we consider to be) daily problems,
and we are getting consumed by them. In the end, what matters the most is how we use the technology
we created, and not let it use us. For it has brought us brilliant things, from medical domains
to transportation. It will make drivers, tomorrow, an endangered species. Are we ready to
accomodate such immeasurable changes in our society? Well... looks like time will tell.
